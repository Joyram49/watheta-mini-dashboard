## üß† Core Design Principles

| Principle                | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**          | Codebase structured to support growth without becoming complex.                       |
| **Reusability**          | UI built from reusable Radix primitives and composable components.                    |
| **Accessibility (a11y)** | All interactive elements use accessible Radix foundations.                            |
| **Type Safety**          | Full end-to-end safety with TypeScript and Zod schemas.                               |
| **Performance**          | TanStack Query for caching, concurrent React 19 features, and optimized UI rendering. |
| **Consistency**          | Prettier + ESLint + Tailwind Merge enforce stylistic and structural consistency.      |
